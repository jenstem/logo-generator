## Description

As a current student, I wanted to create a SVG Logo Generator that would help a user to create a logo for their company or app.  The SVG Logo Generator would walk the user through each necessary part of the file and prompt them to enter in the necessary information.

The user wouldn't need to style or add any code to create the SVG file, simply the information when prompted.  The logo would then be generated using the information that the user provided.  Allowing the user to quickly and easily generate their own logo.
